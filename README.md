# Genome-Matching
This repository contains code snippets for basic genomic sequence analysis tasks. The code demonstrates functions for reading a genome from a file, performing pattern matching using a naive algorithm, and generating random reads from a genome.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
   git clone https://github.com/rishii100/genomic-sequence-analysis.git
```
1.Install the required dependencies (if any).

2.Open a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment that supports Jupyter Notebooks.

3.Open the notebook file containing the code snippets.

4.Execute each code cell in the notebook to see the output and understand the functionality of each code snippet.
